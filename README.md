# Programming Basics: Conditionals

These exercises are aimed at making you more comfortable with using conditionals as well as operators. Use "if" statements to complete the following exercises. Print your results to the console.

* Work from the `solution.js` file provided in this repository.

1. Declare the variables `int1` and `int2`, assign them number values and Check if the two given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (this includes both 50 and 99). Print true if either of them are in the range.

2. Declare the variable `int3`, assign it a number value  and Check if the three given integer values are in the range 50 to 99 (inclusive). Print true if one or more of them are in the range.

3. Declare the variables `a`, `b` and `c` and give them number values. Check which one out of the three variables has the largest value and print it to the console. do the same with `int1`, `int2` and `int3`. Then change the values of the variables to see if your conditional still works. 

4. Declare the variables `str` with value `"thon"`. If the given string begins with "Py" then print the original string, otherwise add the prefix "Py" to the behinning of the string and print the result. Change the value of `str` to test your condition.

5. Calculate the sum of `int1` and `int2`. If the sum is in the range 50 to 80, print 65, otherwise print 80. 

6. Declare the variables `int4` and `int5` Check whether their sum is 8, or whether their difference is 8. If one of these is the case, print true. otherwise print false.

7. Check whether either one of `int4` or `int5` is 15, or if their sum is 15. If one of these is the case, print true. otherwise print false. 

8. Check whether either one of `int4` or `int5` is a multiple of 7 or 11. If so, print true. otherwise print false.

9. Calculate the sum of `int4` and `int5`. If the two values are equal, then print triple their sum. otherwise just return their sum.

10. Calculate the difference between `int5` and the number 19. Print double the difference if the value of `int5` is greater than 19. Otherwise just print the difference.

11. BONUS CHALLENGE:  Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values. Create an if/else statement to check whether the person's age is less than 13. If so, print "firstName is a child". If the age is equal to or more than 13 and less than 20, print "firstName is a teenager". If the person's age is equal to and more than 20 and less than 30, then print "firstName is a young adult". If none of these conditions apply, print "firstName is a adult". 

12. BONUS CHALLENGE: Play around with each of your results, i.e., make sure they are dynamic to different inputs; is there a more efficient way of writing your code?; etc.
